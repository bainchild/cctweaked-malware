# Malware for ComputerCraft tweaked.
---
Uses [unBIOS](https://gist.github.com/MCJack123/42bc69d3757226c966da752df80437dc) by jackmacwindows,  
and the [bios from craftos2-rom](https://github.com/MCJack123/craftos2-rom) by jackmacwindows and cc:t devs  
in the chroot malware.
---
All of the malware in this repository  
uses `motd.lua` as the way to persist.  
This means that it runs before startup & disk startups,  
and will be enabled by default in most scenarios.  
### NOTE: motd is disabled by `bios.lua` on pocket computers!  
  
All of the malware has a `startup.lua` file, which is intended to  
be ran by having `shell.allow_disk_startup` enabled and the disk present at boot,  
but can also be ran manually. As soon as I find a way to infect machines  
over rednet/modems, I will definitely implement it.
